-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interactive mode:
*Interactive mode is based on this ideology only.
*In the interactive mode as we enter a command and press enter, the very next step we get the output. 

Script Mode:
*Script etymologically means a system of writing.
*In the script mode, a python program can be written in a file.
