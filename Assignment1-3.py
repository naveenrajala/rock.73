What is the Difference Between Shell Mode and Script Mode?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Script mode and Interactive mode can be differentiated on the basis of definition, suitability, edit, output, save, and examples.

Definition:
          ---> Script mode is a defined set of steps that need to be followed in order for the computer to understand and carry out the instructions. 
          ---> Interactive mode, on the other hand, is where the user can type in commands and see the results straight away.

Suitability:
         ---> Script mode is more suitable when there is a need to automate tasks or when the same task needs to be carried out several times.          
         ---> The interactive mode is more suitable for one-time tasks or for exploring data.

Edit:
          ---> Script mode is usually edited in a text editor and then run as a batch process.
          ---> Interactive mode can be edited in the same way as commands are typed in, which makes it more user-friendly.

Output:
          ---> Script mode produces output that can be saved and reused.
          ---> Interactive mode produces output that is displayed on the screen and then disappears.

Save:
          ---> Script mode can be saved in a text file.
          ---> Interactive mode cannot be saved, but the user can type commands in an editor and save it as a script file.

Examples:
         ---> Script mode examples can be found on the internet.
         ---> Interactive mode examples can be found by typing “interactive mode” in the Google search bar.
