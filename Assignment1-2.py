           Compilation process                               Java is both compiled and interpreted language.                         Python is an interpreted language
                                          
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            Length of code                        The length of the code of java programs is more as             Python has shorter lines of code as you 
                                                            compared to that of Python as every program has to be      directly write the code and it gets interpr

                                                            the code is-                                                                           For eg-                                               
                                                            public class HelloWorld {                                                     print("Hello World!")
                                                            public static void main(String[] args) {
                                                            System.out.println("Hello, World");}
                                                            }
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------         Complexity of syntax                  Java is a statically typed programming language. There     Python is dynamically typed and there are 
                                                            are hardcore rules for braces and semi-colon.                     no hardcore rules for semi-colon and 
                                                                                                                                                         braces. It works on inundation.

              Ease of typing                       Strongly typed, need to define exact types of                      Dynamically typed, no need to define
                                                            variables.                                                                              type of variables.

                  Speed                                Java is faster as compared to Python.                                  Python is relatively slow as it is interprete
